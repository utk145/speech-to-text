# Speech to Text App

This is a web application that allows users to transcribe speech into text using the browser's speech recognition capabilities. Once the conversion is complete, users can easily copy the transcribed text and share it with others. Whether it's for collaboration, note-taking, or preserving important conversations, this app has got you covered!
